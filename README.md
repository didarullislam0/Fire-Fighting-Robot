# Fire-Fighting-Robot


## Project Description
This is a **Fire Fighting Robot** project, which automatically detects fire and extinguishes it. It is driven by a microcontroller and various sensors are used.

## Features
- Fire Detection
- Water Spraying System
- Control by Microcontroller
- Real Time System

## Required Hardware
- Arduino UNO
- Flame Sensor
- Water Pump
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- Servo Motor

## How to Use
1. Download the code from this repository.
2. Open the code in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your **Arduino UNO**.
4. Connect the required hardware.
5. When the robot is turned on, it will detect fire and automatically spray water.

## Installation
1. Install Arduino IDE (if not already installed).
2. Connect **Flame Sensor** and **Water Pump**.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
4. After running the code, the robot will spray water if it detects fire.
